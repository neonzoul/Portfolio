# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The SaaS Credit & Monetization Engine is a secure, production-ready microservice designed to handle the complete monetization backend for a "pay-as-you-go" automation service. This system manages user accounts, processes credit purchases through Omise payment gateway, and ensures atomic credit spending for workflow execution. The architecture emphasizes security, reliability, and compliance with PCI DSS standards while maintaining clear separation of concerns through microservice patterns.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: User Authentication and Authorization

**User Story:** As a user, I want to securely register and authenticate with the system, so that I can access protected payment and workflow services with proper authorization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user registers with valid email and password THEN the system SHALL create a new user account with hashed password storage
2. WHEN a user logs in with valid credentials THEN the system SHALL return a secure JWT access token
3. WHEN a user accesses protected endpoints THEN the system SHALL validate the JWT token and authorize the request
4. IF authentication fails THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error responses without exposing sensitive information

### Requirement 2: Credit Purchase and Payment Processing

**User Story:** As a user, I want to purchase credit packages through secure payment methods, so that I can use credits to run automation workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user initiates a credit purchase THEN the system SHALL create a payment link/QR code using Omise API
2. WHEN a payment is initiated THEN the system SHALL create a pending purchase record in the database
3. WHEN payment processing begins THEN the system SHALL use client-side tokenization to avoid handling raw card data
4. IF payment fails THEN the system SHALL record the failure with appropriate error codes and messages
5. WHEN payment is successful THEN the system SHALL only update credits through verified webhook notifications

### Requirement 3: Secure Webhook Processing

**User Story:** As the system, I want to securely process Omise webhook notifications, so that user credit balances are updated only when payments are genuinely confirmed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an Omise webhook is received THEN the system SHALL verify the webhook authenticity by calling back to Omise API
2. WHEN a verified successful payment webhook is processed THEN the system SHALL atomically update the user's credit balance
3. WHEN webhook processing occurs THEN the system SHALL handle idempotent processing to prevent duplicate credit additions
4. IF webhook verification fails THEN the system SHALL reject the webhook and log security events
5. WHEN webhook processing completes THEN the system SHALL update purchase status from pending to completed

### Requirement 4: Atomic Credit Spending for Workflows

**User Story:** As a user, I want to run workflows that consume credits, so that I can execute automation services with guaranteed payment before execution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests workflow execution THEN the system SHALL check if user has sufficient credits before execution
2. WHEN sufficient credits exist THEN the system SHALL atomically deduct credits and execute the workflow in a single transaction
3. WHEN insufficient credits exist THEN the system SHALL return 402 Payment Required without executing the workflow
4. WHEN credit deduction occurs THEN the system SHALL ensure the operation is atomic and cannot be partially completed
5. WHEN workflow execution completes THEN the system SHALL log the successful execution and credit usage

### Requirement 5: Workflow Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manage my workflows with defined credit costs, so that I can understand and control my spending on automation services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN workflows are created THEN the system SHALL associate them with specific users and credit costs
2. WHEN a user views their workflows THEN the system SHALL display workflow names and associated credit costs
3. WHEN workflow execution is requested THEN the system SHALL verify workflow ownership before processing
4. IF a user attempts to access another user's workflow THEN the system SHALL deny access with appropriate authorization error

### Requirement 6: Data Security and PCI Compliance

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the system to maintain PCI DSS compliance and security best practices, so that sensitive payment data is protected and regulatory requirements are met.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN handling payment data THEN the system SHALL never store raw cardholder data on application servers
2. WHEN communicating with external services THEN the system SHALL use TLS 1.2 or higher for all connections
3. WHEN storing sensitive credentials THEN the system SHALL use secure key management systems
4. WHEN processing payments THEN the system SHALL implement network segmentation and access controls
5. WHEN security events occur THEN the system SHALL log events for audit trails and monitoring

### Requirement 7: System Resilience and Reliability

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want the system to handle failures gracefully and prevent duplicate operations, so that the service remains reliable under various failure conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN network failures occur during payment processing THEN the system SHALL implement idempotency to prevent duplicate charges
2. WHEN webhook delivery fails THEN the system SHALL handle retry mechanisms and eventual consistency
3. WHEN database transactions fail THEN the system SHALL rollback partial operations to maintain data consistency
4. WHEN external API calls timeout THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate retry logic with exponential backoff
5. WHEN system errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide structured error responses with correlation IDs for debugging

### Requirement 8: Database and State Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to maintain data consistency across distributed operations, so that financial transactions are accurate and auditable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user data is stored THEN the system SHALL use separate databases per service following microservice patterns
2. WHEN cross-service transactions occur THEN the system SHALL implement saga patterns for distributed transaction management
3. WHEN purchase records are created THEN the system SHALL maintain complete audit trails of all payment transactions
4. WHEN credit balances change THEN the system SHALL ensure changes are atomic and properly logged
5. WHEN data relationships exist THEN the system SHALL maintain referential integrity within service boundaries

### Requirement 9: API Design and Integration

**User Story:** As a client application developer, I want to integrate with well-designed REST APIs, so that I can build reliable applications on top of the monetization engine.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API endpoints are designed THEN the system SHALL follow RESTful principles with proper HTTP methods and status codes
2. WHEN API errors occur THEN the system SHALL return structured error responses with machine-readable error codes
3. WHEN API versioning is needed THEN the system SHALL support versioned endpoints for backward compatibility
4. WHEN API requests are made THEN the system SHALL validate input data and provide clear validation error messages
5. WHEN API responses are returned THEN the system SHALL include appropriate headers and follow consistent response formats
