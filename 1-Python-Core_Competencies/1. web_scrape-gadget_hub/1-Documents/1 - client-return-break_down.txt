Here is a clear breakdown of the Return on Investment (ROI) for the client, Chaiwat, based on the simulation and your value-based pricing model. This is how you would communicate the value compared to the price paid.
ROI Analysis for BKK Gadget Hub
The key to value-based pricing is demonstrating that the service is not an expense, but a strategic investment that generates a significant return.
Client's One-Time Investment (Tier 2 Package): 45,000 THB
Here is the value the client receives, broken down into three key areas:
1. Tangible Cost Savings (Recouped Labor)
This is the most direct and measurable return.
 * Client's Time Spent Manually: 2 hours per day (conservative estimate from the scenario).
 * Work Days: 2 hours/day x 5 days/week = 10 hours per week.
 * Value of Time: Using your model's rate for manual data work of 300 THB/hour.
 * Monthly Savings: 10 hours/week x 4.33 weeks/month x 300 THB/hour = 12,990 THB per month.
 * Annual Savings: 12,990 THB x 12 months = 155,880 THB per year.
Result: The system saves the client nearly 13,000 THB every month in labor costs alone. Based on this, the initial 45,000 THB investment is fully paid back in just 3.5 months.
2. Revenue Generation (Opportunity Captured)
This highlights how the data can directly increase profit.
 * Scenario: BKK Gadget Hub sells high-value items. A single lost sale of a PlayStation 5 (~18,000 THB) due to being temporarily overpriced is a significant loss.
 * Value: By providing daily, accurate pricing, the system allows Chaiwat to react instantly to competitor price drops.
 * Result: Capturing just 3 additional high-value sales that would have otherwise been lost to a competitor would completely cover the entire cost of the service. Every sale captured after that is pure, additional profit.
3. Risk Reduction (Informed Decision-Making)
This addresses the cost of making bad decisions based on outdated information.
 * The Problem: Without timely data, Chaiwat is at risk of being either too expensive (losing customers) or too cheap (losing profit margin).
 * The Solution: The automated scraper provides a reliable, daily snapshot of the market.
 * Result: The system acts as a risk-reduction asset, ensuring that pricing strategy is always based on the most current data, protecting both revenue and profit margins.
Summary of the ROI
By investing 45,000 THB one time, the client receives:
 * A system that pays for itself in less than 4 months from labor savings alone.
 * A first-year ROI of over 246% just from the time saved.
 * An invaluable tool for capturing additional revenue and reducing the risk of strategic pricing errors.
