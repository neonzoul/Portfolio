**Subject: Project Kickoff: BKK Gadget Hub Competitor Scraper**

Hello K. Chaiwat,

Thank you for accepting the proposal and placing the order. [cite_start]This message is to formally confirm that the **BKK Gadget Hub Competitor Scraper** project has now officially started. [cite: 1, 2]

[cite_start]I am excited to begin development and build a reliable solution to automate your data collection from `powerbuy.co.th`. [cite: 1, 2]

[cite_start]As per our project timeline, you can expect an initial sample of the scraped data for your review by the end of the day on **Monday, August 4th**. [cite: 1, 2] [cite_start]This will allow us to ensure the data format and content are exactly what you need before the full extraction. [cite: 1, 2]

I will keep you updated on my progress. Please let me know if you have any questions in the meantime.

Best regards,

Moss
