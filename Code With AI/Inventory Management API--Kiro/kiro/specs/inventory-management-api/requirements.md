# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a Basic Inventory Management API that tracks products and their stock levels. The system focuses on correctly managing the state (quantity) of each product as it changes over time, with particular emphasis on preventing race conditions and maintaining data integrity through atomic transactions.

The API will provide RESTful endpoints for creating products, viewing inventory, and managing stock levels through add/remove operations. The system must ensure that stock levels never go negative and handle concurrent operations safely.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Product Data Model

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to define products with essential attributes, so that I can track inventory items with unique identifiers and current stock levels.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a product THEN the system SHALL require a unique SKU (Stock Keeping Unit) as the primary identifier
2. WHEN creating a product THEN the system SHALL require a name field for human-readable identification
3. WHEN creating a product THEN the system SHALL accept an optional description field for additional product details
4. WHEN creating a product THEN the system SHALL require an integer quantity field representing current stock level
5. WHEN storing product data THEN the system SHALL enforce that quantity cannot be negative through database constraints
6. WHEN defining the SKU field THEN the system SHALL ensure it serves as a unique constraint that users interact with

### Requirement 2: Product Creation

**User Story:** As an inventory manager, I want to create new products in the system, so that I can start tracking their stock levels.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN receiving a POST request to /products THEN the system SHALL create a new product with provided SKU, name, and initial quantity
2. WHEN creating a product with a duplicate SKU THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 400 Bad Request
3. WHEN creating a product with invalid data THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 400 Bad Request with validation errors
4. WHEN successfully creating a product THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 201 Created with the product details
5. WHEN creating a product THEN the system SHALL validate that initial quantity is a non-negative integer

### Requirement 3: Product Retrieval

**User Story:** As an inventory manager, I want to view product information and stock levels, so that I can monitor my inventory status.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN receiving a GET request to /products THEN the system SHALL return a list of all products with their current details
2. WHEN receiving a GET request to /products/{sku} THEN the system SHALL return the specific product identified by the SKU
3. WHEN requesting a product with non-existent SKU THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 404 Not Found
4. WHEN successfully retrieving products THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 200 OK with product data
5. WHEN returning product data THEN the system SHALL include SKU, name, description, and current quantity

### Requirement 4: Stock Addition

**User Story:** As an inventory manager, I want to add stock to existing products, so that I can update inventory levels when receiving new shipments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN receiving a PATCH request to /products/{sku}/add THEN the system SHALL increase the product quantity by the specified amount
2. WHEN adding stock THEN the system SHALL require a request body with an "amount" field containing a positive integer
3. WHEN adding stock with invalid amount (negative or non-integer) THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 400 Bad Request
4. WHEN adding stock to non-existent product THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 404 Not Found
5. WHEN successfully adding stock THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 200 OK with updated product details
6. WHEN adding stock THEN the system SHALL perform the operation atomically to prevent race conditions

### Requirement 5: Stock Removal with Safety Constraints

**User Story:** As an inventory manager, I want to remove stock from products when items are sold or damaged, so that I can maintain accurate inventory levels while preventing overselling.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN receiving a PATCH request to /products/{sku}/remove THEN the system SHALL decrease the product quantity by the specified amount
2. WHEN removing stock THEN the system SHALL require a request body with an "amount" field containing a positive integer
3. WHEN removing stock amount greater than available quantity THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 400 Bad Request and NOT modify the quantity
4. WHEN removing stock with invalid amount (negative or non-integer) THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 400 Bad Request
5. WHEN removing stock from non-existent product THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 404 Not Found
6. WHEN successfully removing stock THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 200 OK with updated product details
7. WHEN removing stock THEN the system SHALL use atomic transactions with read-check-update pattern to prevent race conditions

### Requirement 6: Data Integrity and Concurrency Safety

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the system to handle concurrent operations safely, so that inventory data remains accurate even under high load.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple requests attempt to modify the same product simultaneously THEN the system SHALL use atomic transactions to prevent race conditions
2. WHEN performing stock removal operations THEN the system SHALL implement read-check-update pattern within a single transaction
3. WHEN database constraints are violated THEN the system SHALL roll back transactions and return appropriate error responses
4. WHEN any operation fails during a transaction THEN the system SHALL roll back all changes made within that transaction
5. WHEN committing successful operations THEN the system SHALL ensure all changes are persisted atomically

### Requirement 7: RESTful API Design Compliance

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want the API to follow RESTful conventions, so that it is predictable and easy to integrate with.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN designing endpoints THEN the system SHALL use appropriate HTTP verbs (POST for creation, GET for retrieval, PATCH for updates)
2. WHEN designing URLs THEN the system SHALL use resource-based patterns like /products/{sku}
3. WHEN returning responses THEN the system SHALL use appropriate HTTP status codes (200 OK, 201 Created, 400 Bad Request, 404 Not Found)
4. WHEN handling errors THEN the system SHALL return consistent error response formats with meaningful messages
5. WHEN processing requests THEN the system SHALL validate input data and return detailed validation errors when appropriate
