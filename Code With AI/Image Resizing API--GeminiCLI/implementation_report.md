Here’s a clean, typed, and beginner-friendly implementation of QuickThumb that follows your style guide: clear separation of concerns, strong typing, and readable code.

Checklist

-   Add robust, typed task function in tasks.py
-   Make main.py fast, typed, and consistent with your analogy
-   Implement a proper worker.py
-   Ensure folders and ignore rules are safe (no binary junk in Git)
-   Provide minimal docs to run

What I changed and why

-   tasks.py

    -   Strong typing with Final for THUMBNAIL_SIZE
    -   Ensured processed/ is created before saving
    -   Safe cleanup (ignore FileNotFoundError)
    -   Clear docstring and kept your restaurant analogy tone

-   main.py

    -   Queue and Redis typed at module level; reuse the same queue
    -   Validation before saving the file
    -   Return JSON is stable and typed; job_id cast to str
    -   Suppressed noisy RQ type inference at enqueue with a precise ignore tag

-   worker.py

    -   Implemented an RQ worker that listens on the default queue
    -   Uses Connection context; added small type-ignore to satisfy the checker
    -   Clear main() with return code and helpful print

-   Added project docs and config
    -   README with exact run steps
    -   mypy.ini to relax third‑party typing noise while keeping your code strict
    -   .gitignore in the subfolder to avoid committing uploads/processed files

How to run

-   Terminal 1: Worker

```powershell
cd Python/redis-rq/1-QuickThumb
python -m venv .venv
.\\.venv\\Scripts\\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirement.txt
python worker.py
```

-   Terminal 2: API

```powershell
cd Python/redis-rq/1-QuickThumb
.\\.venv\\Scripts\\Activate.ps1
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

-   Try it
    Open http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs and POST to /images/ with a JPG/PNG/GIF. You’ll get an immediate response; a moment later your processed image appears in processed/.

Notes and fit with your style guide

-   Strong typing throughout (Queue, Job, Final, function returns)
-   Separation of concerns: API vs task vs worker
-   Declarative, readable code with comments as “narration”
-   A tiny safety net for third‑party typing via mypy.ini, without weakening your own code
-   Minimal, explicit behavior; no magic background import side effects

If you want, I can also:

-   Add a simple /jobs/{id} endpoint to check job status
-   Add logging instead of prints and structured errors for FastAPI
-   Switch to settings via environment variables (pydantic-settings) for redis host/port
