### \#\# Step 1: Project Setup (Your Workspace)

First, let's get your project folder and files ready.

1.  **Create a Project Folder:** Create a new folder on your computer named `asset_downloader`. All your files will live inside this folder.
2.  **Set Up a Virtual Environment:** Open your terminal, navigate into the `asset_downloader` folder, and run this command. This creates an isolated Python environment for your project.
    -   `python -m venv venv`
3.  **Activate the Environment:** You need to "turn on" this environment.
    -   **On Windows:** `.\venv\Scripts\activate`
    -   **On macOS/Linux:** `source venv/bin/activate`
    -   Your terminal prompt should now start with `(venv)`.
4.  **Create Your Files:** Inside the `asset_downloader` folder, create three empty text files:
    -   `downloader.py` (This will be your main Python script)
    -   `requirements.txt` (This will list your project's dependencies)
    -   `urls.txt` (This will be the list of files to download)
5.  **Edit `requirements.txt`:** Open this file and add one line for the `httpx` library:
    ```
    httpx
    ```
6.  **Edit `urls.txt`:** Open this file and add a few image URLs to test with, one per line. For example:
    ```

    ```
7.  **Install Dependencies:** Now, go back to your terminal (with the `venv` active) and run this command. It will read your `requirements.txt` file and install `httpx`.
    -   `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Your workspace is now ready\!

### \#\# Step 2: Writing the Code (`downloader.py`)

We'll build the script piece by piece. Open your empty `downloader.py` file.

#### **Part A: The Imports**

At the very top of your file, import all the libraries you'll need.

-   **Why?** This tells Python which tools from its standard library and from third-party packages you plan to use.
-   **Guide:**
    ```python
    import asyncio  # For running asynchronous operations
    import httpx   # The library for making HTTP requests
    import os      # For interacting with the operating system (like creating folders and getting filenames)
    import argparse # For parsing command-line arguments
    ```

#### **Part B: Downloading a Single File**

Next, let's define the core task: a function that knows how to download one file.

-   **Why?** By isolating this logic, you can easily run it many times concurrently.
-   **Guide:**
    1.  Define an `async` function called `download_file` that accepts two arguments: `client` and `url`.
    2.  Inside the function, first figure out the filename. You can get the last part of the URL using `url.split('/')[-1]`.
    3.  Create the full path where you want to save the file, for example `os.path.join('downloads', filename)`.
    4.  Print a message saying that the download is starting.
    5.  Use `await client.get(url)` to fetch the content. This is the main network operation.
    6.  After the download, use `response.raise_for_status()` to check for errors (like 404 Not Found).
    7.  Now, save the file. Use Python's `with open(...)` statement to write the `response.content` to the filepath you created. Make sure to open the file in binary-write mode (`'wb'`).
    8.  Finally, print a "Finished" message.

#### **Part C: The Main Orchestrator**

Now, create the main function that will manage all the downloads.

-   **Why?** This function sets up the environment and runs all your `download_file` tasks at the same time.
-   **Guide:**
    1.  Define an `async` function called `main` that accepts one argument: `url_list`.
    2.  The first thing it should do is create the 'downloads' directory. Use `os.makedirs('downloads', exist_ok=True)`. The `exist_ok=True` part cleverly prevents an error if the folder already exists.
    3.  Use the `async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:` block. This creates a single client session that is efficiently reused for all downloads.
    4.  Inside the `with` block, create a list of tasks. You can do this with a list comprehension: `tasks = [download_file(client, url) for url in url_list]`.
    5.  Use `await asyncio.gather(*tasks)` to run all the tasks in your list concurrently.
    6.  After the `await` line, print the final summary message, like "Finished downloading X files."

#### **Part D: Handling Command-Line Input**

This is the final piece. This code will run when you execute the script from your terminal. It's responsible for reading the command-line arguments and the contents of the URL file.

-   **Why?** This makes your script a flexible command-line tool, not just a hardcoded program.
-   **Guide:**
    1.  Add the standard Python entry point: `if __name__ == "__main__":`.
    2.  Inside this block, create an `argparse.ArgumentParser`.
    3.  Add one argument to it using `parser.add_argument('--urls-file', required=True)`. This tells `argparse` to look for a command-line argument named `--urls-file`.
    4.  Parse the arguments using `args = parser.parse_args()`.
    5.  Now, open the file provided by the user (`args.urls_file`) and read all the lines into a list. Remember to strip any extra whitespace from each line.
    6.  Finally, call your main function using `asyncio.run(main(your_list_of_urls))`.

### \#\# Step 3: Run Your Tool

Once you've written all the code, go to your terminal (make sure your `venv` is still active and you are in the `asset_downloader` directory) and run your script with the command-line argument:

bash

```
python downloader.py --urls-file urls.txt


**Download all URLs from urls.txt (default)**
python downloder.py

**Download with custom concurrency**
python downloder.py --concurrent 10

**Download from a different file**
python downloder.py --file my_urls.txt

**Download a single URL**
python downloder.py --url "https://example.com/image.jpg"

**Show help**
python downloder.py --help

```

You should see the progress messages print to the console, and afterward, a `downloads` folder will appear with the images inside\!
