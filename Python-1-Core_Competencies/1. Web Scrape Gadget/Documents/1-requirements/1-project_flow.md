### **Section 1: The Scenario & Client Inquiry**

**The Client:**

-   **Name:** Chaiwat S.
-   **Business:** "BKK Gadget Hub," a growing Thai e-commerce store selling popular electronics.
-   **The Problem:** Chaiwat is struggling to keep his prices competitive. He spends 2-3 hours _every day_ manually checking the prices of his top 20 products on a major competitor's website. He's losing sales when his prices are too high and losing profit when they're too low.
-   **Why He Chose You (The "Higher Price" Justification):** He hired a cheaper freelancer on Fastwork last month. The scraper they built worked for three days and then broke permanently because the competitor's site loads prices with JavaScript. Chaiwat is now frustrated and understands the value of reliability. He was impressed by your professional profile, your clear packages, and especially your **"Ethical Scraping Policy"** and your stated expertise in handling **"complex, dynamic websites."** He is willing to pay more for a solution that _actually works_.

**The Package:** The client has chosen your **Tier 2: "Standard Scraper Setup."**

**The Initial Message (In your inbox tomorrow morning):**

> **Subject: Inquiry about Standard Scraper Setup**
>
> Hello,
>
> I found your profile on Fastwork. I am interested in your "Standard Scraper Setup" package.
>
> I need help tracking competitor prices for my e-commerce store. My last experience with a freelancer for this was not good. Your profile looks much more professional.
>
> Please let me know the next steps.
>
> Thank you,
> Chaiwat S.

### **Section 2: Your First Task (Tomorrow): Requirements Gathering**

**Your Action:** Apply **Phase 1** of your workflow. Respond to Chaiwat, thank him, and send him the **Client Intake Questionnaire** to fill out.

Here is the **completed questionnaire** he sends back to you:

---

#### **Client Intake Questionnaire - BKK Gadget Hub**

-   **Part A: About Your Business & Project Goals**

    1.  **Business Description:** We are an online store, BKK Gadget Hub, selling consumer electronics in Thailand.
    2.  **Primary Objective:** To automatically track the price and stock status of our top 20 products on our main competitor's website (PowerBuy). This data will help us make instant pricing adjustments to stay competitive.
    3.  **Project Success:** Success is a clean data file I receive each morning that is accurate. This will save me hours of manual work and prevent lost sales.

-   **Part B: Data Requirements**
    4\. **Target URL:** `https://www.powerbuy.co.th/th`. I will provide the 20 specific product page URLs.
    5\. **Specific Data Points:** For each product page, I need: `Product Name`, `Price (THB)`, `Stock Status` (e.g., "In Stock", "Out of Stock"), and the `SKU / Product Code`.
    6\. **Estimated Pages:** Exactly 20 pages, but they need to be checked daily. For this project, a one-time pull of all 20 is the goal.

-   **Part C: Technical & Legal Considerations**
    7\. **Login Required:** No, all data is publicly visible.
    8\. **Anti-Scraping Measures:** Yes, I believe so. The last scraper I had built stopped working, and the developer said it was because the site uses JavaScript to load the price after the page loads.
    9\. **Terms of Service:** I have not reviewed them in detail. I trust your ethical policy on this.

-   **Part D: Deliverables & Timeline**
    10\. **Final Format:** CSV file is perfect.
    11\. **Desired Timeline:** I need this data reliably as soon as possible. The delivery date of **August 8th, 2025**, is acceptable.
    12\. **Script Required:** Just the data for this project, but I am interested in the script as a future option.

### **Section 3: The Workflow in Action (Your Sprint Plan)**

This is your plan from tomorrow until delivery.

-   **Day 1 (Fri, July 25): Kickoff**

    1.  Review the questionnaire. The project is a perfect fit for Tier 2.
    2.  Send the formal proposal on Fastwork, confirming scope and price.
    3.  Once accepted, send your Kickoff Confirmation email, stating you will deliver a data sample on **Monday, August 4th**.

-   **Day 2-6 (Mon, July 28 - Fri, Aug 1): Development**

    1.  Build the scraper using Python and **Playwright** to handle the dynamic content on PowerBuy.
    2.  Create your Pydantic model to validate the four data fields (`product_name`, `price_thb`, `stock_status`, `sku`).
    3.  Test rigorously.

-   **Day 7 (Mon, Aug 4): Early Milestone Delivery**

    1.  Run the scraper on 5 of the 20 URLs.
    2.  Deliver the sample `BKK_Gadget_Hub_Sample.csv` to Chaiwat for review. This builds huge trust.

-   **Day 8-9 (Tues, Aug 5 - Wed, Aug 6): Finalization**

    1.  Chaiwat replies that the sample looks perfect.
    2.  Run the scraper on all 20 URLs to get the final dataset.
    3.  Perform the final data cleaning pass.

-   **Day 10 (Thurs, Aug 7): Prepare Deliverables**

    1.  Create the final CSV file.
    2.  Write the **Project Handoff Report**. This is your key "over-deliver" item.

-   **Delivery Day (Fri, Aug 8): Project Handoff**

    1.  Send the final delivery email with the complete, professional package.

### **Section 4: The "Real" Deliverables for the Client**

Here are the simulated assets you would deliver to Chaiwat.

#### **1. The Final Data File (`competitor_prices_2025-08-08.csv`)**

```csv

... (and 15 more rows) ...
```

#### **2. The Project Handoff Report (The Text You'd Put in a PDF)**

> ## **Project Handoff Report: BKK Gadget Hub Competitor Monitoring**
>
> **Date:** August 8, 2025
>
> ---
>
> ### **1. Project Overview**
>
> The primary goal of this project was to develop a robust web scraping solution to automatically extract product data for 20 specified items from `powerbuy.co.th`. The objective is to provide BKK Gadget Hub with timely and accurate business intelligence to inform its competitive pricing strategy.
>
> ### **2. Objectives Achieved**
>
> -   A custom web scraper was successfully developed and executed.
> -   All 20 target product pages were scraped successfully.
> -   The required data points (Product Name, Price, Stock Status, SKU) were extracted and cleaned.
> -   The final, validated dataset has been delivered as per the project scope.
>
> ### **3. Summary of Data Delivered**
>
> -   **File Name:** `competitor_prices_2025-08-08.csv`
> -   **Total Records:** 20
> -   **Data Dictionary:**
>     -   `product_name`: The name of the product as listed on the site. (Type: Text)
>     -   `price_thb`: The product price in Thai Baht. (Type: Number)
>     -   `stock_status`: The availability of the product. (Type: Text)
>     -   `sku`: The unique product code/SKU from the site. (Type: Text)
>
> ### **4. Technical Notes**
>
> The target site, `powerbuy.co.th`, loads critical data like price and stock status dynamically using JavaScript after the initial page load. The scraper was built using Python with the **Playwright** library to ensure this dynamic content was reliably rendered and captured, overcoming the issues that cause simpler scrapers to fail. All extracted data was programmatically validated to ensure type and format consistency.
