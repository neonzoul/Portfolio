**Subject: Proposal for BKK Gadget Hub - Competitor Price Scraper Project**

Hello K. Chaiwat,

Thank you for providing the detailed information in the questionnaire. Itâ€™s very helpful and confirms that the **Standard Scraper Setup** is the perfect fit for your needs.

Based on your requirements, this project will create a custom, reliable scraper to automatically extract data for your 20 specified products from `powerbuy.co.th`. The goal is to provide you with the accurate intelligence you need to save time and optimize your pricing strategy, overcoming the technical issues you've faced in the past.

Here is a summary of the project scope and deliverables:

* **Target Website:** `powerbuy.co.th` (for the 20 product URLs you provide)
* **Data Points to Collect:** Product Name, Price (THB), Stock Status, and SKU
* **Final Deliverables:**
    1.  A clean, ready-to-use data file in CSV format.
    2.  A professional Project Handoff Report summarizing the work and data structure.
* **Project Timeline:** The project will be completed and delivered on or before **Friday, August 8, 2025**.
* **Total Investment:** 45,000 THB (Fixed price, one-time fee)

I have just sent the formal offer through the Fastwork system with these details. Please review and accept it when you're ready, and I will begin the project immediately.

Looking forward to helping you solve this data challenge.

Best regards,

Moss
